A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes workload API object used to manage stateful applications. It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of its Pods.

This is useful for managing applications that need persistent storage or a stable, unique network identity. For example, a database cluster would be a good use case for a StatefulSet.
